# Bus-Carpark-Simulator

Done it React, will be deployed on GitHub pages by Deceber 02 2019

30 Nov 2019: Created as a test for Accordo Group after the first interview (28/11/19).
17 Dec 2019: Made aware of not getting the job.
              Stated reasons: 
                1. Lots of redundant code
                2. Some react components used incorrectly
                3. Inconsistent coding style
## MVP

Get a functional bus to move around a carpark.
  1. Bus has to be placed in the carpark first.
  2. Bus can not leave the carpark.

## Strech
  1. Display user inputs. (Formatted for client)
  2. Display simple rendering of Bus.

If you try copy this code for a job interview, you might get the job tbh, if you're white that is. Rather than brown with an attitude. Jks, idk, I'm getting sick of this shit. Changing that attitud, just for employment reasons.
